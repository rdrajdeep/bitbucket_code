Together, we can take action. Together, the Messengers of Humanity can show their solidarity with the Syrian people.<br/></p>\n<p>In the following weeks, we will send you powerful actions that you can take to make a difference for the people trapped in Syria’s conflict and for the people who had to flee and leave everything behind.</p>\n<p><b>Remember, you are not alone!</b> The UN and our partners in Syria are delivering aid to millions of civilians, trying their best to reach as many people as possible. And on 4 and 5 May, world leaders will come together in Brussels to discuss the future of Syria and to find a lasting political resolution.</p>\n<h2><b>Her are 4 actions you can take to support refugees & displaced people</b></h2>\n<p><b>1.      </b><b>Make sure that Syria is not forgotten – share on social media</b></p>\n<p>UNICEF released this moving video of 10-year-old Ansam, a blind girl who was displaced by the violence in Syria. Her song is a message of hope to the world. Children such as Ansam are not giving up and neither should we. Please share!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ctt.ec/dOtqG\"><b>Click here to tweet: Do you wish there was something you could do to help #Syria? Check out these 4 actions that you can take now <a href=\"http://bit.ly/4thingsyoucando\">http://bit.ly/4thingsyoucando</a></b></a></p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKnkwyLxp88I\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnkwyLxp88I?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p> <b>2.      </b><b>Encourage universities to offer scholarships for refugees</b></p>\n<p>For refugee students, not being able to continue their studies is devastating. Help them by writing an e-mail or a letter to your own university or a college near you and ask them to support a refugee. You can also e-mail major universities in the USA, asking them to admit more refugees. <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/action/refugee-university-admissions/\"><b>Here is a handy template.</b></a></p>\n<p><b>3.      </b><b>Support internally displaced people in Syria</b></p>\n<p>We hear a lot about refugees who seek safety outside Syria, but more than six million Syrians are displaced within their own country. They are often forced to flee at very short notice and have to leave everything behind. Many of them find refuge with host families, but others have to stay in overcrowded shelters. As the conflict continues, they are struggling to find food and water and are in dire need of humanitarian aid. If you want to help internally displaced people in Syria, <b>y<a href=\"https://secure.globalproblems-globalsolutions.org/site/Donation2?11261.donation=form1&amp;df_id=11261&amp;mfc_pref=T\">ou can donate to the UN’s humanitarian fund in Syria</a></b>. Your donation will provide emergency food, water, shelter, medicine and other life-saving assistance to those who need it most.</p>\n<p><b>4.      </b><b>Help refugees to integrate into a new culture</b></p>\n<p>Refugees often feel lonely and isolated when they try to restart their life in a new country. Could you see yourself mentoring a refugee family? Imagine teaching the kids your language or helping the parents figure out the public transport system. Even small gestures of friendship can mean a great deal! A quick Google search can show you which groups and local non-profits are active in your area and looking for volunteers.</p>\n<p>That’s it for today! Stay tuned, because over the following weeks and months we’ll share more actions that you can take to make a difference. </p>\n</blockquote>",

You’re a big deal, let your voice be heard & your face be seen! (or something like that) You guys are great, and I’m proud of each and every one of you for having the strength to be who you are - whatever that is, even if you’re the only one who knows it, or even if you don’t know what “it” is yet. No matter what, you’re beautiful people ❤️❤️<br/><br/>Stay tuned for a special TDOV comic at 9:00 AM (EST) & some pictures of my face later as well </p></blockquote>\n<p>Happy <b><a href=\"http://tumblr.com/search/tdov\">Trans Day of Visibility</a></b>, Tumblr. <3</p>",
